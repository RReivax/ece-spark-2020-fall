# Data Engineering with Spark

## Lab 5: Machine Learning With Spark

### Prerequisites

Connect to the Adaltas cloud cluster using OpenVPN.

### Goals

Learn how to build ML models with Spark, analyzing AirBnB data:
- Understand the logic of modeling with spark.ml during demo with Linear Regression
- Apply your knowledge to create a Random Forest model on the same dataset

### Lab resources

- The data: `airbnb_clean.csv` that can be found in `/education/ece/big-data/2020/fall/bda/resources/lab5/` 

### Useful links

- [Spark MLlib Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html)
- If you want to download the book [Learning Spark](https://databricks.com/p/ebook/learning-spark-from-oreilly)

### TO DO

1. We will build Linear Regression model together during demo.
2. You will build Random Forest Regression model independently. Reuse the code from the Linear Regression.
